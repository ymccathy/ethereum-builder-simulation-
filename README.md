This project simulates strategic behavior among Ethereum block builders under Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) and EIP-1559. It tests whether builders can form profitable cartels by coordinating to underfill blocks, manipulate base fees, and exploit the resulting demand surges.
Research Question: Can Ethereum builders profit from cartel coordination despite game-theoretic incentives to defect?
